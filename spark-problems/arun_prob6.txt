Problem 6: 
Provide two solutions for steps 2 to 7

Using HIVE QL over Hive Context
Using Spark SQL over Spark SQL Context or by using RDDs

1.
create a hive meta store database named problem6 and import all tables from mysql retail_db database into hive meta store. 

2.
On spark shell use data available on meta store as source and perform step 3,4,5 and 6. [this proves your ability to use meta store as a source] 

3.
Rank products within department by price and order by department ascending and rank descending [this proves you can produce ranked and sorted data on joined data sets]

4.
find top 10 customers with most unique product purchases. if more than one customer has the same number of product purchases then the customer with the lowest customer_id will take precedence [this proves you can produce aggregate statistics on joined datasets]

5.
On dataset from step 3, apply filter such that only products less than 100 are extracted [this proves you can use subqueries and also filter data]

6.
On dataset from step 4, extract details of products purchased by top 10 customers which are priced at less than 100 USD per unit [this proves you can use subqueries and also filter data]

7.
Store the result of 5 and 6 in new meta store tables within hive. [this proves your ability to use metastore as a sink]
