Problem 4:
1.
Import orders table from mysql as text file to the destination /user/cloudera/problem5/text. Fields should be terminated by a tab character ("\t") character and lines should be terminated by new line character ("\n"). 
2.
Import orders table from mysql  into hdfs to the destination /user/cloudera/problem5/avro. File should be stored as avro file.
3.
Import orders table from mysql  into hdfs  to folders /user/cloudera/problem5/parquet. File should be stored as parquet file.
4.
Transform/Convert data-files at /user/cloudera/problem5/avro and store the converted file at the following locations and file formats

save the data to hdfs using snappy compression as parquet file at /user/cloudera/problem5/parquet-snappy-compress
save the data to hdfs using gzip compression as text file at /user/cloudera/problem5/text-gzip-compress
save the data to hdfs using no compression as sequence file at /user/cloudera/problem5/sequence
save the data to hdfs using snappy compression as text file at /user/cloudera/problem5/text-snappy-compress

5.
Transform/Convert data-files at /user/cloudera/problem5/parquet-snappy-compress and store the converted file at the following locations and file formats

save the data to hdfs using no compression as parquet file at /user/cloudera/problem5/parquet-no-compress
save the data to hdfs using snappy compression as avro file at /user/cloudera/problem5/avro-snappy

6.
Transform/Convert data-files at /user/cloudera/problem5/avro-snappy and store the converted file at the following locations and file formats

save the data to hdfs using no compression as json file at /user/cloudera/problem5/json-no-compress
save the data to hdfs using gzip compression as json file at /user/cloudera/problem5/json-gzip

7.
Transform/Convert data-files at  /user/cloudera/problem5/json-gzip and store the converted file at the following locations and file formats
save the data to as comma separated text using gzip compression at   /user/cloudera/problem5/csv-gzip

8.
Using spark access data at /user/cloudera/problem5/sequence and stored it back to hdfs using no compression as ORC file to HDFS to destination /user/cloudera/problem5/orc
