1.
create a hive meta store database named problem6 and import all tables from mysql retail_db database into hive meta store. 
STEP 1: Create HIVE DATABASE --- 
create database kkd_problem6 location '/user/kranthidr/arun/kkd_problem6';

STEP 2: Don't use --hive-create-table option

STEP 3:

sqoop import-all-tables \
--connect 'jdbc:mysql://ms.itversity.com:3306/retail_db' --username retail_user --password itversity \
--hive-import --hive-database kkd_problem6 \
--warehouse-dir /user/kranthidr/arun/kkd_problem6 --num-mappers 1

sqoop eval \
--connect jdbc:mysql://ms.itversity.com:3306/retail_db --username retail_user --password itversity \
--query "show DATABASES"

2.
On spark shell use data available on meta store as source and perform step 3,4,5 and 6. [this proves your ability to use meta store as a source] 

HIVE
>>drop database kkd_problm6 cascade;
>>show databases like 'kkd*';
>>show databases like 'kranthi*';
kranthi_db
kranthidr_db
kranthidr_retail_db_txt
3.
Rank products within department by price and order by department ascending and rank descending [this proves you can produce ranked and sorted data on joined data sets]

USE kkd_problem6;

select department_id, department_name, product_price, rank() over(partition by department_id order by product_price desc) rank from products join categories on product_category_id == category_id join departments on category_department_id = department_id limit 10;

select department_id, department_name, product_price, rank() over(partition by department_id order by product_price desc) rank from products join categories on product_category_id == category_id join departments on category_department_id = department_id order by department_name,rank asc limit 10;

4.
find top 10 customers with most unique product purchases. if more than one customer has the same number of product purchases then the customer with the lowest customer_id will take precedence [this proves you can produce aggregate statistics on joined datasets]

select customer_id, count(distinct(order_item_product_id)) num_unique_purch from order_items join orders on order_id = order_item_order_id join customers on customer_id = order_customer_id join products on product_id = order_item_product_id group by customer_id order by num_unique_purch desc limit 10;

5.
On dataset from step 3, apply filter such that only products less than 100 are extracted [this proves you can use subqueries and also filter data]

create view ranked_products as select department_id, department_name, product_id, product_price, rank() over(partition by department_id order by product_price desc) rank from products p join categories on product_category_id = category_id join departments on category_department_id = department_id order by department_name,rank asc;

select * from ranked_products where product_price < 100;

create view productsle100 as select * from products where product_price < 100;

select department_id, department_name, product_id, product_price, rank() over(partition by department_id order by product_price desc) rank from productsle100 join categories on product_category_id == category_id join departments on category_department_id = department_id order by department_name,rank asc;
 
6.
On dataset from step 4, extract details of products purchased by top 10 customers which are priced at less than 100 USD per unit [this proves you can use subqueries and also filter data]

select customer_id, count(distinct(order_item_product_id)) num_unique_purch from order_items join orders on order_id = order_item_order_id join customers on customer_id = order_customer_id join productsle100 on product_id = order_item_product_id group by customer_id order by num_unique_purch desc limit 10;

7.
Store the result of 5 and 6 in new meta store tables within hive. [this proves your ability to use metastore as a sink]

create table hive_ranked_products_department_lt100 as select department_id, department_name, product_id, product_price, rank() over(partition by department_id order by product_price desc) rank from productsle100 join categories on product_category_id == category_id join departments on category_department_id = department_id order by department_name,rank asc;

create table hive_top10_customers_uprods_lt100_1 as select customer_id, count(distinct(order_item_product_id)) num_unique_purch from order_items join orders on order_id = order_item_order_id join customers on customer_id = order_customer_id join productsle100 on product_id = order_item_product_id group by customer_id order by num_unique_purch desc;

create table hive_top10_customers_uprods_lt100 as select customer_id, count(distinct(order_item_product_id)) num_unique_purch from order_items join orders on order_id = order_item_order_id join customers on customer_id = order_customer_id join productsle100 on product_id = order_item_product_id group by customer_id order by num_unique_purch desc limit 10;

SPARK
3.
Rank products within department by price and order by department ascending and rank descending [this proves you can produce ranked and sorted data on joined data sets]

import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Window
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

spark.sql("USE kkd_problem6")
val prods = spark.sql("select * from products")

val op1 = joined1.select('department_id,'department_name, 'product_id, 'product_price, ran1).orderBy('department_name,'rank.asc)

op1.show()

4.
find top 10 customers with most unique product purchases. if more than one customer has the same number of product purchases then the customer with the lowest customer_id will take precedence [this proves you can produce aggregate statistics on joined datasets]

val oi = spark.sql("select * from order_items")

val prods = spark.sql("select * from products")

val joined2 = oi.join(ords,'order_id === 'order_item_order_id).join(custs, 'customer_id === 'order_customer_id).join(prods, 'product_id === 'order_item_product_id).select('customer_id, concat('customer_fname, lit(" "), 'customer_lname), 'order_item_product_id, 'product_name)

val op2 = joined2.groupBy('customer_id).agg(countDistinct('order_item_product_id).as("num_unique_purch")).orderBy('num_unique_purch.desc).limit(10)

op2.show()

5.
On dataset from step 3, apply filter such that only products less than 100 are extracted [this proves you can use subqueries and also filter data]

val op3 = joined1.filter("product_price < 100").select('department_id,'department_name, 'product_price, ran1).orderBy('department_name,'rank.asc)

op3.show()

6.
On dataset from step 4, extract details of products purchased by top 10 customers which are priced at less than 100 USD per unit [this proves you can use subqueries and also filter data]

val op4 = joined2.filter("product_price < 100").groupBy('customer_id).agg(countDistinct('order_item_product_id).as("num_unique_purch")).orderBy('num_unique_purch.desc).limit(10)

op4.show()
7.
Store the result of 5 and 6 in new meta store tables within hive. [this proves your ability to use metastore as a sink]
op3.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("ranked_products_department_lt100")

op4.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("top10_customers_uprods_lt100")
