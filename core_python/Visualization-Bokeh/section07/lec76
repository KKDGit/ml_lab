Deploying Interactive Bokeh Server Apps as Standalone
Section 7, Lecture 76
In case you're wondering how to deploy standalone Bokeh Server apps without embedding them in Flask,
the answer is you have already done that. In this section we deployed both Flask and Bokeh
but our Bokeh Server app can also be accessed through port 5006.
For example, mine is live at http://159.203.118.48:5006/. I can later connect that link to a domain name in
DigitalOcean and have my Bokeh Server app accessed through it instead of typing in the IP and the port.
 There are various domain registrars you can get a domain from such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, HoistGator, etc.
 but DigitalOcean has a clear guide here on how to connect a domain (after purchasing the domain from the registrar).

Similarly, if you want to deploy Flask apps with static Bokeh plots embedded in the Flask app,
you repeat the same steps except you don't create a configuration file (i.e. bokeh_serve.conf) for Bokeh.
You simply deploy the Flask app and the Bokeh graph is embedded in it as a one-time HTML script, so no need for Bokeh Server.
