    "is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to \n",

    "often referred to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore \n",
    "will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any \n",
    "generalization power. For instance, a model with 500,000 binary parameters could easily be made to learn the class of every digits in the \n",
    "MNIST training set: we would only need 10 binary parameters for each of the 50,000 digits. Such a model would be useless for classifying \n",
    "new digit samples. Always keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge \n",
    "is generalization, not fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in \n",
    "order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets \n",
    "-- precisely the type of representations that we are interested in. At the same time, keep in mind that you should be using models that have \n",
    "enough parameters that they won't be underfitting: your model shouldn't be starved for memorization resources. There is a compromise to be \n",
    "found between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine what the right number of layers is, or what the right size for each layer is. You \n",
    "will have to evaluate an array of different architectures (on your validation set, not on your test set, of course) in order to find the \n",
    "right model size for your data. The general workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few layers and \n",

    "You may be familiar with _Occam's Razor_ principle: given two explanations for something, the explanation most likely to be correct is the \n",
    "\"simplest\" one, the one that makes the least amount of assumptions. This also applies to the models learned by neural networks: given some \n",
    "training data and a network architecture, there are multiple sets of weights values (multiple _models_) that could explain the data, and \n",
    "simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"simple model\" in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy (or a model with fewer \n",
    "parameters altogether, as we saw in the section above). Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity \n",
    "of a network by forcing its weights to only take small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more \"regular\". This is called \n",
    "\"weight regularization\", and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a _cost_ associated with having large weights. This \n",
    "cost comes in two flavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* L1 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the _absolute value of the weights coefficients_ (i.e. to what is called the \n",
    "\"L1 norm\" of the weights).\n",
    "* L2 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the _square of the value of the weights coefficients_ (i.e. to what is called \n",
    "the \"L2 norm\" of the weights). L2 regularization is also called _weight decay_ in the context of neural networks. Don't let the different \n",
    "name confuse you: weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.\n",
